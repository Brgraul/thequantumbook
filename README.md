### Your hands-on guide to navigate Quantum Technologies and it's business impact

We believe that at the current point in time, the degree to which we can forecast or aleviate some of our society's most pressing problems is limited by the computational tools available. Progressing Quantum Computing will bring immense benefits in areas such as Healthcare and Climate Change. Use cases that benefit society should be the ones driving technological progress. Not the other way around. We help you bring to market science that cares.

This is an open source, living document, to which you are more than invited to make pull requests. Let collaboration and goodwill be the foundations of Quantum Technologies.
