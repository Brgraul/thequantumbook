# The Quantum Book
Your one-stop, application-focused source for learning about Quantum Technologies.

We aim to democratize and lower the entry barrier to the domain of Quantum Computing and other Quantum Technolgies. 

This is an open source, living document, to which you are more than invited to make pull requests. 
We are as wise as our willingness to learn from other. Let's build the foundations of Quantum Technologies around collaboration and goodwill.
