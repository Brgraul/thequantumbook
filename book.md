### Why is Quantum Computing relevant?

The degree to which we can forecast or alleviate some of our society's most pressing problems, like Healthcare and Climate Predictions, is limited by the computational tools that are currently available. 

Quantum Computing has the potential to super-charge all the fields that have computations at the core of their business by making these faster, more accurate, and unlocking problems not solvable with conventional approaches. Some application domains for the technology are Pharmaceuticals, Material Science, Artificial Intelligence, Finance, and Logistics. The expected time-to-industry of the technology is 5 to 10 years depending on the application domain.
 
### Who are the current users of Quantum products?

Companies that have computations at the core of their business but are unwilling to invest in creating an in-house team. Think about Fortune 500-100 companies in sectors as Automotive, Aerospace, Pharmaceuticals, Materials, and Finance. These enterprises invest in Quantum a limited part of their R&D budget, in most of the cases bellow seven digits. The low investment is allocated mainly to proofs of concept and some educational workshops. However, the willingness to invest in the early adopters increases when there are governmental incentives for Quantum, which justifies the large US market for QC.

Note, Academia and Government also represent a significant share of the end-users for Quantum technologies. Research groups are highly specialized in concrete components of the Quantum value chain, and thus externalize the elements out of their research focus required in their experiments. Governments have a strategical interest in Quantum, as the technology will have an effect on the technological competitiveness of the country and has applications in Warfare. Quantum communications provided a channel that allows knowing when the message is intercepted and Quantum sensing enables positioning the enemy with unseen accuracy.
 
### What's the motivation of early adopters?

Quantum technologies promise an exponential speedup, and thus an exponential edge on the competition. This disruptive potential makes enterprises and governments consider Quantum as one of their potential options to stay competitive and innovative. However, the returns from adopting Quantum technologies are delayed 5 to 10 years into the future, being too distant to be considered an attractive investment opportunity.
 
### The Quantum Value Chain

Defined top to bottom. It's possible to operate as a company at any level of the value chain, or even take a mix of them as your value proposition.

- **Service providers**: They create tailored solutions created for a specific customer.
- **Software solutions**: Software solutions built to cope with recurring user needs: algorithm libraries, abstraction frameworks, application domain SW, platforms.
- **Fundamental Software**: Software necessary for the basic functioning of quantum computers. Control SW, OS, simulators, compilers, runtime, microcode standards (QASM).
- **Auxiliary Hardware**: Those components non-specific to Quantum, but necessary for QC operation. Cooling, superconducting cables.
- **Fundamental Hardware**: Base hardware constituents of Quantum computing architecture. Quantum processing units.
 
### Most frequent business models in Quantum Computing

Business models in quantum computing refers to the part of the 

- **Full-stack**: These players try to cover the value chain from end to end. Adopting this strategy makes them more robust by removing dependencies on external stakeholders. This strategy requires high external financing, as covering diverse competencies is highly resource-intensive.
- **Hardware-first**: Full focus on building the base components of quantum computers. This strategy is also highly capital intensive, as revenues will come until when shipping the first functioning product. The definition of functioning is relative: In the case of processors, they can drive sales as soon as they are good enough to serve as an experimental testbed for research institutes.
- **Software-first**: The companies making a profit at this level of the value chain build software products with two types of algorithms at their core:
    - **Quantum-inspired algorithms.** These methods outperform conventional ones based on the algorithmic ideas coming for Quantum. These do work, therefore selling these doesn't differ much from traditional software solutions
    - **Real quantum algorithms**. The companies doing the latter deliver proofs of concept of specific application domain problems in few-qubit machines. These solutions are consulting work built for one particular customer. As problems repeat over time, companies identify core functionalities from which they can make products.
 
### Example of a sales pipeline for a QC SW Startup

1. **Intro** to the customer. They usually already have some basic expertise on Quantum.
2. **Use cases workshop** to fix their current most pressing problems. The goal is to obtain a first longlist that could be solved with other technologies.
3. **Identification** of the **problems** that could be tackled with **quantum** technologies.
4. **Proof of Concept** for a specific problem.
5. **Upsell your tool** as a way to power their future, in-house quantum team.
 
### Some German QC Startups

- **Heisenberg Quantum Systems (HQS)**, Karlsruhe - They use Quantum Computing to solve computational Chemistry problems, like predicting the molecular properties of materials in ways it was not possible before. They have substantial intellectual property (IP) in quantum error correction.
- **IQM**, Munich - They aim to become a full-stack Quantum Computer provider, building Quantum Computers and the corresponding Sofware.
- **Quantum-Factory**, Munich - They are a service provider, creating proofs of concept of quantum algorithms for other companies.
